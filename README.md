My Portfolio website for potential employers, it displays past projects that can be updated over time as well as my current skills. 

## UX

The portfolio website needed to be a way for me to showcase my skills and work to a potiential employer to do this I created a basic single page layout that took the user through my skills and projects and gave them a way to see my code on both github and through a live preview.

## Features

The site has a My Work section that displays my work on both Github and a live preview of the page.

## Features left to implement

- Email to be sent on form submission
- Further Example Projects
- Form Validation

## Testing

1) Usability and Visual Impact:
    - Project Purpose - The site needed to dispaly my work and skills - this has been done by providing links to projects and listing my skills
    - UX design - the site has been structured in sections that alternate in colour and style to make it easier to use.
    - Navigation - The site has a navbar that sticks to the top of the page for ease of use.
    - Information has been laid out in sections with titles to help users find what they are looking for.

2) Layout and Visual Impact:
    - The site is responsive to mobile, depending which device you are on columns are displayed differently, this has been tested on multiple devices .
    - I have One image for simplicty and load speeds of the page that scales easily.
    - The colour scheme helps break sections up and making it easier to see where one starts and one ends.

3) Code Quality:
    Both HTML and CSS have been validated using online validation tools to ensure the code quality is kept.

4) Software Development practices:
    - The project was updated using git and github and was commited regurlary
    - The Folder structure follows best practices having both CSS and Images within thier own folder.
    - The files are commented to make it easier to update.
